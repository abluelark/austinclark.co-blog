## Professional Life

### Talent Development
I'm currently a **Program Manager** for the Learning and Development team at [https://deepwatch.com](Deepwatch). In short, I take business challenges, turn challenges into goals, and then implement training programs to help address those chalenges. Or for an even shorter summary: I create those employer-made training videos and courses you are asked to take. As a talent development professional, it's my goal to make these training opportunites as effective as possible.

Before joining Deepwatch, I was a high school music teacher for several years.
