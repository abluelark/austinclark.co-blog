  description: How I use AI on this site.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have proliferated across the internet, finding accurate, quality, and insightful information has been frustrating. It's difficult to think of anything more wasteful of anyone's time and energy than to read AI-generated blog posts.

The main reason I started this blog is to curate my own little nook on the internet to share my **authentic** self to the world. Using AI to write, edit, formulate, or modify any of my writing goes against my reasoning for this site. I hope as a reader you see this as a courtesy.

### How I use AI

LLMs are the only AI tools I use in my daily workflow; their responsibility is to mainly ingest knowledge in a more rapid manner. Here are some practical examples of how I use AI: 
- Asking for a summary of a large piece of text (like a book or business report)
- Asking to explain a new programming language using examples
- Troubleshooting code
- Asking how to compare how several ideas might interact with each other
  - For example: _"given this book, how might I take on this business challenge"_.
- Audio Processing for extremely bad audio sources
- Closed-captioning for video editing 

### AI technologies I do not use
Here are some common tools that many individuals use that I do not. 
- Image Generation
- Audio/Video Modeling
- Video Editing (beyond captioning)
- Predictive Text
- Digital Assistants (including Siri, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Assistant)

I am continually looking for new responsible ways to use AI in my day-to-day workflow. If you disagree with my positions about AI-generated content, or want me to try some new AI tool out, please send me an email...and try not to write the email using AI.
